This repository contains code for the zumo-bot challenge given in the course TDT4112 at NTNU spring 2016.

Examles are to be saved in the examples\ folder

zumo-bot.ino is the main program, slave.ino is to be run on the slave arduino

Needs libraries from https://github.com/IDI-PLab/plab-library

Built using Pololu Zumo Robot for Arduino, https://www.pololu.com/category/169/zumo-robot-for-arduino and two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The pair of sensors we used suffered from a timeout problem, and the sketch incorporates code to reset them.
